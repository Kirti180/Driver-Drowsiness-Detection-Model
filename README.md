# Driver Drowsiness Detection Model

## Description
The Driver Drowsiness Detection Model is a machine learning-based system designed to detect when a driver is falling asleep or drowsy while driving. It utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to analyze facial expressions and eye movements of the driver to determine their level of alertness. If the model detects signs of drowsiness, it triggers an alarm or sound to alert the driver, potentially preventing accidents due to driver fatigue.
